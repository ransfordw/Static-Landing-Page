                <p>Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
                It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Imagination is the key to painting. Just use the old one inch brush. There are no limits in this world. Just make little strokes like that.
                Let's go up in here, and start having some fun This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
                This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

                <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You're meant to have fun in life. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.
                We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
                If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Every time you practice, you learn more. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>
